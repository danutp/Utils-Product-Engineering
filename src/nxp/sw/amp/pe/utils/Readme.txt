This is the first version of UtilsNG, a collection of utilities and APIs. Currently, the main purpose is to be used as
wrapper for interaction with Atlassian API. This can be achieved by instantiating one of the three designated classes:
JiraUtils, BitbucketUtils or BambooUtils by specifing the project key, the username and the password, which needs to be
sent base64 encoded.
